Last time:
----------
-implemented validation (not tested yet)
-restructured as class, AnDNN
-implemented vgg (to same extent as fully_connected)


todo:
-----
-test fully connected validation
-test vgg
-implement checkpointing (this is maybe working in andnn_old.py)
-implement loading of weights from npy file
-implement fcn8/YOLO/others :)
-asynchronous batching


Questions/notes:
----------------
why is fc_layer not equivalent to tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected?  Or is it?


Unrelated, but Remember (daily):
--------------------------------
-practice c++
-do ML coursera
-svgpathtools bug and group support


Unrelated, but Remember (one-time):
