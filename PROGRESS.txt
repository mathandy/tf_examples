Last time:
----------

-fcn both training and now (tabby_cat) test work!
-started rewriting fcn (to make sure I understand)


todo:
-----
-finish rewriting fcn8
--figure out what which variables are "with decay" and make them that way (see p.5 of fcn paper)
--use momentum 0.9 (see p.5)
--was averaging the 1000 classes into desired number something the fcn paper talked about?
--implement weight reshaping/loading/saving

-figure out how textsegnet gets bounding boxes
-implement YOLO/others :)

Questions/notes:
----------------
why is fc_layer not equivalent to tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected?  Or is it?


Unrelated, but Remember (daily):
--------------------------------
-practice c++
-do ML coursera
-svgpathtools bug and group support


Unrelated, but Remember (one-time):
-----------------------------------
-can i use git to automatically remove trailing whitespace when committing?
